    <h1>Top 3 Billy Joel Albumns</h1>

      <p>
        The Stranger is easily the best Billy Joel albumn as it doesn't contain
        a single bad song and it has many of the songs people commonly consider
        to be Joel's best including "Vienna" and "Scenes From an Italian Restaurant"

      <p>
        Released in 1978, 52cnd Street was Joel's next albumn after The Stranger and while it couldn't beat the perfection of Stranger, it delivered a track list full of new and unique bangers such as "Zanzibar", "Honesty", and "Big Shot".While the track list on this album isnt quite as strong as The Stranger, I would argue that there isnt a single song on this album that can be considered bad or bland

      <p>
        While Glass Houses contains many of Joel's lesser known songs it is still easily one of his best. This album truly shows Joel's love of exploring different musical styles. On one hand this album contains rock hits such as "You May Be Right" and "All For Leyna". However, it also contains songs such as "Through the Long Night" and "Don't Ask Me Why" which are reminiscent of earlier Billy Joel works. Overall this album can be outshined by The Stranger or 52cnd Street, but it is still a fantastic albumn
