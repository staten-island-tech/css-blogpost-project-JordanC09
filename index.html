      <p>
        The Stranger is easily the best Billy Joel album as it doesn't contain a
        single bad song and it has many of the songs people commonly consider to
        be Joel's best including "Vienna" and "Scenes From an Italian
        Restaurant"

      </h2>
      <img src="images/52Street.JPG" alt="52cndStreet" />
      <p>
        Released in 1978, 52cnd Street was Joel's next album after The Stranger
        and while it couldn't beat the perfection of Stranger, it delivered a
        track list full of new and unique bangers such as "Zanzibar", "Honesty",
        and "Big Shot".While the track list on this album isnt quite as strong
        as The Stranger, I would argue that there isnt a single song on this
        album that can be considered bad or bland

      </h2>
      <img src="images/GlassHouses.jpg" alt="GlassHouses" />
      <p>
        While Glass Houses contains many of Joel's lesser known songs it is
        still easily one of his best. This album truly shows Joel's love of
        exploring different musical styles. On one hand this album contains rock
        hits such as "You May Be Right" and "All For Leyna". However, it also
        contains songs such as "Through the Long Night" and "Don't Ask Me Why"
        which are reminiscent of earlier Billy Joel works. Overall this album
        can be outshined by The Stranger or 52cnd Street, but it is still a
        fantastic album
